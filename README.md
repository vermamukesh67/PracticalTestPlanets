This is the practical test app

list of recommendations for future features and improvements

Making UI better 

▪    by including the Images as well for planet in the list
▪    caching of images as well along with planet data for offline viewing 
▪    lazy load of images for image showing from url 
▪    Pagination or load more data feature on the list scrolls to bottom or last records 
▪    Showing only one record in list for exam : only planet name is not good , we should show some other useful info about the planet of which users cares about for exam : i have shown the territory in bottom of name 


Refresh Bar Item on right bar in screen.

▪    I have added the refresh control in screen on the right corner if user is offline and want to refresh the data once he come online
▪    Not showing the refresh control if net is there 

API improvements

▪    There should be the unique planet id for each Planet Data
▪    So planet id can be used uniquely to identify the Planet Data in api as well in our core data base for updating and deleting the particular data from the database
